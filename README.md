# rbae

Just a small utility bot I wrote for some Discord friends; it's mainly a way for
me to practice Ruby, which I had only used very little in the past, so don't expect
much quality / organization in the short-term.

## Currently supported functionality

The following features (which are currently always enabled) are supported:
- `youtube-dl`-based music streaming (supports per-channel queues in a very primitive way)
- WolframAlpha short answer API queries

## Contributing / Using

I urge you not to use this bot, or maybe even contribute to this bot; instead, try
looking for bots that support open chat standards instead (do as I say, not as I do).
